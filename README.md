# Magento2
An e-commerce website using Magento 2 filled with sample data. I've created a new theme based on Luma and I've programmatically added a new block on the homepage above the "Hot Seller" section named "Custom CMS Block." On the product listing page I've programmatically added a display of SKU. On the product detail page I've programmatically added the product details paragraph above the color selection swatches and removed it from the bottom tab section.
